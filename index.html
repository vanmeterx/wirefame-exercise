                We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. 
                That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. 
                Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. 
                You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or 
                you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You can spend all day playing with mountains. 
                Use your imagination, let it go. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.
                Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. 
                Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We don't have to be concerned about it. 
                We just have to let it fall where it will. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. 
                Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. 
                Nothing wrong with washing your brush. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. The least little bit can do so much. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.
